## 🔬 **State-of-the-Art Vision Transformer Architecture**

This project leverages the powerful `google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k` Vision Transformer model, fine-tuned specifically for **binary MRI classification**. The system distinguishes between:

* **Tumor Detected**
* **No Tumor**

with high precision and reliable consistency.

By harnessing ViT’s attention-based feature extraction, the model excels in identifying subtle abnormalities often missed by traditional CNNs.

## 🖥️ **Modern and Intuitive Streamlit Interface**

A clean, responsive, and elegantly designed **Streamlit application** forms the frontend of this project.
The interface provides:

* Effortless MRI image upload
* Smooth preview of the uploaded scan
* Instant prediction with visual emphasis
* Custom-designed CSS for premium user experience
* Educational content for medical awareness

This UI ensures accessibility for students, researchers, and healthcare learners.

## ⚕️ **Comprehensive Health Awareness Integration**

Beyond predictions, the application includes a curated sidebar that provides:

* **Causes of brain tumors**
* **Risk factors and medical considerations**
* **Lifestyle do's and don'ts**
* **Symptoms and guidance**
* **General well-being tips**

This transforms the system into a holistic educational tool—not just a classifier.
